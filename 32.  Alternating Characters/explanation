This function needs to complete and determine the minimum number of deletions required so that 
no two adjacent characters are the same in a string. The string s consisting of letters like A 
and B is given. And it must delete characters until there are no consecutive repeating characters. 
To finish this function, first is to initialize the "int deletions = 0;" this is for counter to store 
the number of deletions required. Using for loop for the string starting from the second character 
(i = 1). Next is the if statement to check if the current character is the same as the previous one. 
But if two consecutive characters are the same, increment the deletion counter. Lastly, after checking 
all of this it will return to the total number of deletions needed.

The program wants to finish the function by naming the function aVeryBigSum, and it must return the sum. 
To solve this, first initialize the "long sum = 0;" and "i = 0" for looping. Next is to check "i < ar.Count" 
to see if the loop should execute another iteration or not. Because "ar.Count" represents the total 
number of elements in the list. The looping will continue only if the "ar.Count" is less than the count. 
If the condition is "yes," the process will execute the "sum += ar." The index i is 
incremented by 1, preparing the loop to check the next element. But if it is 
false, it will go directly to "return sum," and the process will end here.

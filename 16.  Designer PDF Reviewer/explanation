In this function, ask to calculate the highlighted area of a word in a PDF viewer. Each lowercase letter 
a–z has a given height (h[0] to h[25]).It has a width = number of letters, height = tallest letter in the word. 
Return the area of the highlighted rectangle. Initialize "int height = 0;", a variable for storing the 
tallest letter height in the word. Using foreach loop for each character "w" in the word. The "int index 
= w - 'a';" is for converting the character to an index between 0–25 corresponding to a–z. Next is the if 
statement to check if the current letter’s height is greater than the tallest found so far. "height = h[index];", 
if yes, update height to the current letter’s height. After calculating the area of the rectangle's height and width it will return the area.

In this problem the function name called hurdleRace The function has two given values, which are k and height. 
The solution must return how many doses of a magic potion the character needs to jump the highest hurdle. 
To finish the program, first, look for the tallest hurdle by looping through all the heights and keeping 
the maximum value. Next, I add subtraction on the characterâ€™s jump height k from the maximum hurdle height. 
If the result was less than zero, that means no potion is needed, so it is set to 0. And finally, I returned 
the number of doses needed.

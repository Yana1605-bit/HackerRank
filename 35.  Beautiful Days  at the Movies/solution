This problem has a function name called beautifulDays and it has three given values, i, j, and k.
The solution must return how many days are considered beautiful. To solve the function, I used loop from 
day i to day j. For each day, to reverse its digits it needs to subtract from the original number.
If the absolute difference is divisible by k, it will increase the counter. Lastly, I returned the total count of beautiful days.

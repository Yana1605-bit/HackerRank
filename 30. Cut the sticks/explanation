The problem that HackerRank gave me is called Cut the Sticks. In this problem the function name is cutTheSticks and has one value "arr".
The solution must return how many sticks are cut in each round until no sticks remain. To solve the function, I used a while loop. 
In each loop, I added the current number of sticks to the result, found the smallest stick, subtracted it from all sticks, and removed 
the ones that became zero. Lastly, I returned the result list.

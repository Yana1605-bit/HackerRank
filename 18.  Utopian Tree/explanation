The function Utopian Tree needs to calculate the height of a tree after n growth cycles. 
First, initialize the height of the tree to 1 meter. Now create a looping for each growing cycle 
from 0 to n - 1. Using if-else statement to check if the cycle number is even (spring), double the height. 
Else, if the cycle number is odd (summer), increase the height by 1. And then it will return to the final height after all cycles.

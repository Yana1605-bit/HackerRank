The Bon Appetit ask to determine if a bill was split fairly between the two friends. "bill" is for the list of item prices, "k" 
is for the one person who didn't eat, and "b" is the amount that 
one person actually paid. To solve this, initialize first the variable "var total = 0;" to hold the sum of the items 
that the friend actually ate. For loop for loops of all items in the bill. Using if statement, to check if 
the current item is not the one the friend didn’t eat. Next is the "total += bill[i];" that adds the price of 
items the friend ate to the total. The "int fairShare = total / 2;" divides the total cost of eaten items 
equally between two friends. After that, using a if-else statement to check if the amount paid b equals the fair share. 
If yes, print “Bon Appetit”. Else, If the amount is more than fair share, it will print the extra amount that was overpaid.

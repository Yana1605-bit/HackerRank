In this problem it needs to determine which prisoner will receive the last candy. It provide that 
there are n prisoners sitting in a circle. And m candies are distributed sequentially starting from 
prisoner s. And return the number of the prisoner who receives the last candy. The "int lastCandy = (s + 
m - 1) % n;" is for calculating the position of the last candy using modulo. Next, using if-else 
statement, to check if modulo result is 0, it means the last candy lands on the last prisoner (n) in the circle. 
And it will return to the last prisoner's number if the modulo is 0. Else, it will return to the calculated position as the prisoner who gets the last candy.

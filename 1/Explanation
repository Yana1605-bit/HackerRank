The Solve Me First is the function name, and this function has two values, 
a and b, and it must return an integer value. The (int a, int b) are the parameters of a function. 
To solve this function, I read the problem first. Since the two values a and b are already declared, 
I proceed to the process, and the process I do is putting return a + b. 
because it adds them together and returns the result.

dayOfProgrammer is the function name in this problem and has only one value "year". And the 
solution must return the exact date of the 256th day of that year. First checked if the year 
is 1918, because that year Russia switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, 
and the answer is fixed as "26.09.1918". If the year is before 1918 (Julian calendar), then any 
year divisible by 4 is a leap year, so the date is "12.09.year", but if it is "13.09.year". If 
the year is after 1918 (Gregorian calendar), then a leap year is determined if the year is divisible 
by 400, or divisible by 4 but not by 100, in that case the date is "12.09.year", otherwise "13.09.year". 
And, it will return the date as a string.

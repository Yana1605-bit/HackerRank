The equalizeArray function solves the problem of finding the minimum number of deletions needed to make all elements in an array equal. To solve this,
First, the array is sorted so that identical numbers are grouped together. Then, the program counts the frequency of each number while keeping 
track of the highest frequency found. Since the optimal solution is to keep the number that 
appears most often and remove all others, the minimum deletions required are calculated as the total 
number of elements in the array minus the highest frequency. Lastly, the result is returned.

The program needs to determine the maximum amount of money you can spend to buy one keyboard and 
one USB drive without exceeding a budget b. To solve this, initialize first the variable to store 
the maximum amount spent. The -1 is used if no combination is affordable. Using the foreach loop 
for each keyboard price. Another foreach loop will be used for each USB drive price for the current 
keyboard. The "int totalCost = k + d;" is for calculating the the total cost of the current keyboard
and drive combination. The If statement to check if the total cost is within the budget and higher
than any previous combination. "maxSpent = totalCost;" for updated maxSpent if the current 
combination is better.And lastly, after checking all of this it will return to the maximum amount spent.

On this program, the function has two given values "k" and "a". The solution must return "YES" if the 
class is canceled, or "NO" if the class continues. To solve this, first, count how many students arrived 
on time or early by checking if their arrival time was less than or equal to 0. Next is compare the number 
of students who arrived on time with the required number k. If the arrived students are greater than or 
equal to k, the class will continue, it will return "NO". But if the class is canceled, it is "YES".

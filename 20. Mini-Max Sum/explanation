The function name in this problem called miniMaxSum. This function has one value, a list "arr".
The solution on the problem must print the minimum sum and the maximum sum using exactly four 
out of five integers. First step to solve this is to calculate the total sum of all numbers in the list.
Next, finding the smallest value using "arr.Min()" and the largest value using "arr.Max()".
Then subtract the largest value from the total to get the minimum sum, and subtracted the smallest 
value from the total to get the maximum sum. For the result, I printed both sums together.

This function ask to track how many times a player breaks their lowest and highest score records. 
It needs to count how many times the player scores higher than all previous scores (high record) and lower than all 
previous scores (low record). The "int highScore = scores[0];", and "int lowScore = scores[0];" initializes the highest 
and lowest scores. While the "int highRecord = 0;" and "int lowRecord = 0;" initialize counters for the number of times 
the high and low records are broken. Using a for loop for loops in the scores starting on the second game. 
If-else statement will be use here to check "if (scores[i] > highScore)" if the current score is higher than the current 
high score, update the high score and increment the high record counter. Else if the current score is lower than the 
current low score, update the low score and increment the low record counter. After that it will return to the list containing 
the number of times high and low records were broken.

This function named Staircase, need to print the right-alignment of staircase in # symbols with n steps and each steps has spaces on the left and 
hashes on the right to form like a staircase. To solve this problem, using for loop, for the outer loop is for the rows of the staircase and the "i" 
represents the current row number and the inner loop is for the spaces on the left. Each row has spaces to align the staircase. The "Console.Write(" ");" 
is for the single space without moving to a new line. The second inner loop is for # and each row prints "i" hashes. While the "Console.Write("#");" 
is for single hash without moving to a new line. Last is the "Console.WriteLine();" to move it to the next line after the spaces and hashes for current row.

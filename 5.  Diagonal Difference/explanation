In this function named diagonalDifference, it needs to find the positive difference between the sum of the numbers on the grid's top-left-to-bottom-right 
line and the sum of the numbers on the top-right-to-bottom-left line. To make a code for this, first is to initialize the size "int n = arr.Count;", 
the primary diagonal "int first = 0;", and the secondary diagonal "int second = 0;". I used two loops for row(i) 
and row(j) to check every single number. If the row (i) equals the column (j), then the number is on the primary diagonal. 
It's added to the first total. But, if the row (i) plus the column (j) equals nâˆ’1, the number is on the secondary diagonal. 
It's added to the second total. Lastly, it calculates the difference by subtracting second from first. 
If the difference is a negative number, the code makes it positive. Then it will print the final positive difference.

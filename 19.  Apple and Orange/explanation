In this problem in the HacerkRank, the function name is countApplesAndOranges and this function has six 
values which are s, t, a, b, apples, and oranges. Based on this problem, the solution must print how 
many apples and oranges fall on Sam’s house. First is to set two counters "appleCount" and "orangeCount". 
Then I add a loop for each apple, added its distance to the apple tree position a, and checked if it landed 
between s and t. If yes, it will increased the apple counter. I did the same for the oranges, adding each 
distance to the orange tree position b, and counted the ones that landed on the house. Lastly, I printed 
the number of apples and oranges that landed on Sam’s house.

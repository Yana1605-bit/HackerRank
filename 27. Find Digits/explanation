In the HackerRank problem has a function name called findDigits and has only one value 'n'. 
The solution must return how many digits of n evenly divide n. First, made a coopy of "n" 
called "num". Then, i used while loop for each step, and it will use the last digit using 
"num % 10". If the digit is not zero and n is divisible by that digit, then it will increase 
the counter. After checking, it will remove the last digit by dividing num by 10. And the 
result, it will return to the total count of digits.

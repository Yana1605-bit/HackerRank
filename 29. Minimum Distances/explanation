In this problem the function name is minimumDistances and has one value, "a". The solution must return the 
minimum distance between two equal elements in the list, or -1 if no such pair exists. To finish this prblem, 
I first set minDis to the maximum integer value to keep track of the smallest distance found. Then I used two 
nested for loops: the outer loop goes through each element, and the inner loop compares it with the elements after it.
If the two elements are the same, calculate the distance between their positions. If this distance is smaller than 
the current minDis, I updated minDis with the new value. After checking all pairs, if minDis is still the maximum 
integer value, that means no equal elements were found, so it will returned -1. But if the minDis is not it returned 
the minimum distance found.

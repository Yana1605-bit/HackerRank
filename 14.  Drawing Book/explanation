The problem is to find he minimum number of pages to turn to reach a target page in a book. 
This problem provides the total number of pages n and the target page p, return the minimum turns needed. 
The "int frontP = p / 2;" will calculates the number of turns from the front. And each page turn flips 2 
pages (left and right) and will divide it by 2 gives the turns. "int backP = (n / 2) - (p / 2);" for 
calculating the number of turns from the back. The n/2 gives total turns to reach the end and the subtract 
p/2 to find turns from the back to page p. Using if-else statement, to compare which direction requires fewer 
turns. If turning from the front is less, return that number of turns. Else, it return the number of turns from the back.

The function in the problem in HackerRank that gave me is called beautifulTriplets. this function has two values "d" and "arr".
The solution must return how many triplets (a, b, c) exist such that b = a + d and c = a + 2d. To solve the function, 
I use looping through each element a in the list, then calculated b and c. If both values are found in the list, 
it will increas the counter. And lastly, I returned the total number of beautiful triplets for the result.

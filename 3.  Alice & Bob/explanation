This function problem named compareTriplets needs to compare the two lists of three numbers each for Alice (a)
and Bob (b) to show who has more points. To solve this, declare it first and start with zero: "Alice = 0;" and "Bob = 0." 
Next is a for loop to check each pair of numbers at the same position. So, if Alice's number (a[i]) is bigger than Bob's (b[i]), 
then Alice gets a point (Alice++). But, if Bob (b[i]) is bigger than Alice, Bob has a point 
(Bob++). Lastly, it returns a new list with just the two scores (return List<int> {Alice, Bob};).
